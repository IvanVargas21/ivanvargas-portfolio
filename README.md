# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
I’m an aspiring web developer showcasing the projects I’ve built using PHP, Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design. This portfolio reflects my commitment to creating functional and visually appealing websites, while applying the knowledge I've gained so far in web development.

Each project here represents a step in my journey as I continue to grow and refine my skills. I’ve focused on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites, ensuring they work seamlessly across devices. While I'm new to React, I'm excited to integrate this powerful framework into future projects as I continue to expand my toolkit.

Thank you for checking out my work, and I look forward to further learning and improving as I grow in my development career.
