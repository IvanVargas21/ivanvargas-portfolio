# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and includes some ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Welcome to My Portfolio

I’m an aspiring web developer showcasing the projects I’ve built using **PHP**, **Bootstrap**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Responsive Web Design**. This portfolio represents my commitment to creating functional and visually appealing websites while applying the knowledge I've gained so far in web development.

Each project here is a milestone in my journey as I continue to grow and refine my skills. I focus on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that work seamlessly across devices. Though I'm new to **React**, I'm eager to integrate this powerful framework into future projects as I expand my toolkit.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to continuing my learning and development as I grow in my career.
